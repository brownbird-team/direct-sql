# PandaSQL

PandaSQL is platform used to practice and learn MySQL. Development of PandaSQL is still in progress, but we should finish it by the end of this school year. More details about this project will be present in documentation once we write it.

Platform itself will be written in JS and will use NodeJS as backend. For HTTP API we plan to use Express JS library. About MySQL interface, we are still considering multiple options, but we might end up choosing even simple mysql library. Frontend will be written using React or Svelte JS frameworks.

Also whole project and it's documentation will from now on be written in English.
